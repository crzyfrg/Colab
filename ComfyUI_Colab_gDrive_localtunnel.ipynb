        "*   The initial notebook setup included parameters for `DRIVE_BASE`, `CHECKPOINT_URL`, and `LOCALTUNNEL_SUBDOMAIN`, which were reviewed and confirmed as correctly defined, though their usage required the cell defining them to be executed first.\n",
        "*   The Google Drive mounting and directory setup code was found to be correct and robust, utilizing `os.makedirs(..., exist_ok=True)` and `os.symlink` appropriately for Drive-backed folders.\n",
        "*   The system package and localtunnel installation commands using `apt-get` and `npm` were appropriate for the Colab environment, but a critical issue was later identified where the `lt` command was not reliably available in the PATH immediately after installation.\n",
        "*   The code for cloning or updating the ComfyUI repository correctly handled both initial cloning and subsequent pulling using `git`, but lacked verification that essential files like `main.py` were present, leading to later failures.\n",
        "*   The Python dependency installation correctly used `requirements.txt` and attempted to install a specific torch wheel, but the use of `|| true` could hide errors, the fallback mechanism didn't guarantee a CUDA-enabled torch, and a necessary dependency (`torchsde`) was initially missing.\n",
        "*   The most significant issue identified was in the server startup and localtunnel exposure cell. The original code **did not** include the command to start localtunnel, making the server inaccessible publicly. The method for checking server readiness was also basic, and error handling for server crashes or localtunnel failures was limited.\n",
        "*   During the fixing process, a critical issue arose where the `ComfyUI/main.py` file was not present after the initial `git pull` or `clone` attempts, preventing the server from starting. This required adding explicit verification and potentially re-cloning the repository.\n",
        "*   A `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'torchsde'` was encountered after fixing the repository issue, highlighting a missing dependency.\n",
        "*   A `FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'lt'` occurred after resolving the dependency issue, indicating that the localtunnel command was not found in the system's PATH despite the installation step.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The most critical fix required was integrating the localtunnel startup into the server launch sequence, along with robust checks to ensure the ComfyUI server is fully ready before attempting exposure.\n",
        "*   Adding verification steps after file operations (like cloning the repository or installing tools) is crucial in ephemeral environments like Colab to catch errors early. This includes checking for the existence of key files (`main.py`) and command availability (`lt`).\n",
        "*   Improving dependency installation robustness by ensuring specific, necessary packages like `torchsde` are included and enhancing error handling for torch installation (e.g., verifying CUDA support) would make the notebook more reliable across different Colab runtimes.\n"
